This is a java desktop application that serves as a diary. This was my homework when i was at high school and just started learning to code so sorry for the poorly coded app. :)

1. You need to have a MySQL installed on your pc
2. create a database `diary_crud`
3. import the `sql/Database.sql` file to your database
4. change the value in `src/diary_crud/DatabaseCon.java`
