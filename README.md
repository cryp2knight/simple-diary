# simple-diary
This is a java desktop application that serves as a diary. This was my homework when i was at high school and just started learning to code so sorry for the poorly coded app. :)

## How to run
1. You need to have a MySQL installed on your pc
2. create a database $ diary_crud $
3. import the """ sql/Database.sql """ file to your database
